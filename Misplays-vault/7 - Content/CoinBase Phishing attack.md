"Coinbase was compromised December 26th, 2024. Initially it was reported they were compromised in early to mid-May. The (to the best of our knowledge) unidentified Threat Actors(s) maintained persistent access for nearly 6 months."

# Script

Have you heard about the coinbase breach? What if I told you the people that did this just paid their way in?

I know it sounds crazy but on May 11th, Coinbase was compromised and 100's of thousands of users data was stolen. We are talking Name, address, email, phone number, and even images of your government issued ID.

These attackers proved that they didnt need any fancy zero day, or sophisticated hack. They proved the age-old adage, Money Talks. 

Targeting non-US workers, the attackers just slid them some cash that was probably worth close to a year's salary. I mean we are talking about workers whose monthly income is roughly $100 USD a month. 

These attackers bribed these workers and were able to gain access and copy users data. Using that data they launched sophisticated sms-phishing attacks and began to compromise wallets and drain them. Ill talk more about the campaign in a later video.

The crazy part is that when the disclosure was made public, turns out they actually got popped on December 26th, having almost a full 6 months of access to the User data and Coinbase network.

The weirdest part about all of this is after the hackers were "done" with this data, they demanded 20 million to not leak the users info. Coinbase looked at this and said bet and offered 20 million as a reward for information leading to the attackers arrest. single handedly producing the biggest Uno reverse card since the time I made my little sister cry. 

Moral of the story is simple, sometimes the best key to a locked door isnt a password... its a paycheck.
