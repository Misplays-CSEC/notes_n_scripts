# Rough Idea

Recently made a video regarding an Ai agent being the number 1 US hacker, tie into that video or call back to it so it leads others to that video as well. 

Sum up the video and bring up the personal experience where I have encountered AI slop from an actual companies

# Notes from Source

Very clearly start to see the ai formatting

The addition of ai is bombarding these bb programs and is making them ineffective

# Script

One of the things I was super thankful about graduating college when I did is that ChatGPT came out after I was gone. 

I hated those discussion boards and replying to classmates I did not know nor cared about (no offense) but this was year 2 into covid. I didnt think Ashley or Bret had anything insightful to add to the discussion board.

Fast forward 4 years later and now all the kids are doing chatGPT, College kids, Highschoolers hell even the fifth graders from southpark.

it is so bad that we have coined new AI vocab and call things that are obviously made by AI with no oversight 'AI Slop'. Now teachers are having hard time catching it, kids feel punished if they dont use it and the reason why I am even bringing it up is that the slop monster is coming for cybersecurity.

Low Level broke this down on his channel but essentially this user submitted a bug bounty report to cURL and it was this amazing one of a kind critical P1 ultra rare bug and would you believe it... it was just AI slop. This user submitted a bug report for money reporting a vulnerability in a function that does not exist. Didnt even take the time to check the AI's work. It was so attrocious that the Founder and lead developer for cURL came out in a linkedIn post stating that they have been bombarded with these ai slop reports and are banning any reported who submit reports that they deem to be AI slop.

Now I believe that ai has its place in cybersecurity whether thats in detections, or pre report writing or assisting with automation. But people who use ai and claim it as their authentic work are just adding to the problem. 

Thats all I have please check out Low Level on youtube he did a full breakdown of the report and the "bug" the user "found"
