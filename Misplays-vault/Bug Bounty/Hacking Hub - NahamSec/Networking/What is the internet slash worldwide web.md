### Notes

- **Internet vs. World Wide Web**  
  - Internet = global collection of connected networks  
  - World Wide Web = websites accessed via browsers over the internet  
  - The web is part of the internet, not the whole thing  

- **What is a Network?**  
  - Home networks include routers, PCs, phones, smart devices  
  - Devices communicate via cables or Wi-Fi  
  - LAN (Local Area Network) = small, local (e.g. home, office)  
  - WAN (Wide Area Network) = large-scale, interconnected networks (e.g. internet)

- **Network Layouts (Topologies)**  
  - Different structures used over time  
  - **Star topology**: All devices connect through a central switch/router  
    - Common in modern networks  
  - **Mesh topology**: Gaining popularity again due to modern Wi-Fi  
  - Central device (switch) controls data flow between devices  
    - Remembers which port connects to which device  
    - Directs traffic efficiently  

- **Switch vs. Hub**  
  - **Hub**: Repeats data to all ports  
  - **Switch**: Sends data only to intended recipient’s port  
  - Switch = more efficient and secure

- **Extending Networks with Routers**  
  - Routers connect multiple networks  
  - Enables global communication through ISPs  
  - Data can travel via:  
    - Fiber optics  
    - Copper lines  
    - Satellite  
    - 4G/5G mobile networks

### Summary  
The internet is a vast network of connected networks, while the web is a collection of websites accessed via browsers. Networks can be local (LAN) or wide-area (WAN), using topologies like star or mesh. Switches have replaced hubs for better traffic management. Routers allow networks to interconnect, enabling global access through various mediums like fiber or wireless.
