# Hook

Remember that coinbase breach, our good friend over on twitter that goes by the handle NanoBaiter broke down what the attackers did once they were able to get in.

# Surge in attacks

after the data was stolen, an uptick in scams targeting coinbase and binance users were noticed. I remember getting a few of these messages but the proof was observed on Reddit and Twitter

# Scam Layout

The scam followed a typical format

1. A withdrawal request was made on your account

2. Your password was reset 

3. A suspicious login attempt was made on your account 

The scammers will always add a sense of urgency and provide a support number telling people to contact

# On the inside

Nano indicates that he was able to gain access to the scammers computers and identified that their main form of communication was telegram and free phone services like FreePBX to spoof support numbers

# Using stolen data

not only were they using data that they obtained but also buying data dumps and using them to continue their sophisticated phishing campaign

The scammers were also using ChatGPT to parse the data into usable files and feed it into programs that would send mass scam messages to the victims like these

Try and see if you can put multiple scam messages on the screen from the breach

# Once they got a bite

Even with multiple people catching the scam, its called phishing for a reason, you only need one bite. Once someone believes the scam they then message a telegram bot that initiates an email from help@coinbase to initiate a recovery process which was just another layer in the scam

# Victory Screech

Then its just plug n play, they drain the victim post their wins in a group chat and celebrate the successful scam
